# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project: 

The purpose of this analysis is to help an up-and-coming playwright, Louise, who is planning a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play, Fever. She hopes to raise at least $10,000 and wants to know if there are any hidden factors that might help her campaign succeed.

## Analysis and Challenges: 

We performed data analysis on several thousand crowdfunding projects to see if there are any trends that make a campaign more likely to be successful. We analyzed two data points, launch date and goal amount.

We did not run into any challenges during our analysis. 

## Outcomes by Launch

We saw a trend based on launch date as there was a clear peak and decline in the success rate based on which month the campaign was launched. The most successful campaigns were launched in Spring and Summer months, with a peak in May. The least successful campaigns were launched in Winter months.  We concluded that a Spring or Summer launch would more likely to result in a successful campaign, however there is still around 30-50% chance of failure throughout the year. 

## Outcomes by Goals

We did not find a trend of the success rate being affected by the goal amount, but the most successful campaigns were ones with goals of $1000 or less. There was also a peak around $35,000, however there is no evidence that the goal amount was the reason for that spike.

Campaigns in Louise’s goal range of “$10,000 to $14,999” were about 55% likely to succeed. 

Given the data did not point to a clear trend we cannot conclude that goal amount alone would affect Louise’s success rate. We suggest analyzing additional data points. 

There were limitations in this data set as it was missing some more detailed information. Factors that could possibly show some trends would be:
* Amount each backer pledged
* Minimum pledge amount (if any)
* Genre of each play

If we had other data points such as the above suggestions we could create a box and whisker plot, which would show any possible outliers that may be skewing the distributions from our analysis.
