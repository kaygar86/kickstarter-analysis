Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Analysis and Challenges: Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.

Results: Answer the following questions in complete and coherent sentences.

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

What are some limitations of this dataset?

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

The purpose of this analysis is to help an up-and-coming playwright, Louise, who is planning a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play, Fever. She hopes to raise at least $10,000 and wants to know if there are any hidden factors that might help her campaign succeed.

We performed data analysis on several thousand crowdfunding projects to see if there are any trends that make a campaign more likely to be successful. We analyzed two data points, launch date and goal amount, to see if they tended to affect campaign outcomes.  

Outcomes by Launch

We did see a trend based on launch date as there was a clear peak and decline in the success rate based on which month the campaign was launched. The most successful campaigns were launched in Spring and Summer months, with a peak in May. The least successful campaigns were launched in December and January.  A Spring or Summer launch would more likely to result in a successful campaign, however there is still around 30-50% chance of failure throughout the year. 

Outcomes by Goals

We did not find a trend of the success rate changing based on goal amount, but the most successful campaigns were ones with goals of $1000 or less. There was also a peak around $35,000, however it is not certain that the goal amount was the reason for that spike.

Campaigns in Louise’s goal range of “$10,000 to $14,999” were about 55% likely to succeed. 

Given the data did not point to a clear trend we cannot conclude that goal amount alone would affect Louise’s success rate. We suggest analyzing additional data points. 

There were limitations in this data set as it was missing some more detailed information. Factors that could possibly show some trends would be:
* Amount each backer pledged
* Minimum pledge amount (if any)
* Genre of each play
